# Objective

This repository aims to document my studies in software engineering based on [coding interview university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university) and other sources. 

# Study Plan

- [Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis](#algorithmic-complexity--big-o--asymptotic-analysis)

## 1. Algorithmic complexity / Big-O / Asymptotic analysis

- Nothing to implement here, you're just watching videos and taking notes! Yay!
- There are a lot of videos here. Just watch enough until you understand it. You can always come back and review.
- Don't worry if you don't understand all the math behind it.
- You just need to understand how to express the complexity of an algorithm in terms of Big-O.
